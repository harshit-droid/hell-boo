       <p>  There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string.

Historically, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the middle of the 16th
              century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first international matches in the
              second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 
              100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the Laws
              of Cricket which is owned and maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in 
              the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies, its globalisation occurring 
              during the expansion of the British Empire and remaining popular into the 21st century.[1] Women's cricket, which is
              organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playing international 
              cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other
              country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country. </p>
